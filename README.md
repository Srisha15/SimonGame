# 🎮 Simon Game

A web-based clone of the classic **Simon Game**, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Challenge your memory as the game plays an ever-increasing sequence of colors and sounds that you need to repeat in the correct order!

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of lights and sounds played by the game.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
4. The game adds one more step to the sequence each round.
5. If you click the wrong button, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing any key again.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## 🎨 Features

- Colorful and responsive UI
- Interactive button animations
- Sound effects for each color
- Game-over effects
- Keyboard control to start/reset

## 🧠 What I learnt
DOM Manipulation with JavaScript:

I gained hands-on experience in selecting elements, handling events, and dynamically updating the UI.


Event Handling:

I learned how to listen to and respond to keyboard and mouse events to control the game flow.


Game Logic Design:

I implemented logic for generating random sequences, checking user input step-by-step, and handling game-over conditions.


Arrays and Control Flow:

I practiced using arrays to store and compare sequences, and used loops and conditionals effectively.


Debugging and Testing:

Through testing different scenarios (like wrong clicks or rapid inputs), I developed better debugging skills and an understanding of edge cases in interactive applications.

## Thought for the repo--

🧼 What did JavaScript say to Java?
